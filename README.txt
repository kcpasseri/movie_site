This project was completed using information from Udacity's "Programming Foundations with Python"
and a (slightly modified) fresh_tomatoes.py file that was provided.
  -Added background image
  -added movie storylines (from IMDB)

To compile the HTML page, simply run entertainment_center.py

The compiled HTML page is also hosted on my personal site at:
